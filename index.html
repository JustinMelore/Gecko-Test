A popular beginner's reptile, the leopard gecko, is an easily handled, small lizard from Afghanistan, Pakistan,
northwest India, and Iran. Compared to other lizards, they require minimal care. They have perky personalities and make
movements that are interesting to watch. Leopard geckos are commonly yellow, white, and spotted with black dots.
Hatchlings are striped and gradually change to the spotted appearance. There are several colorful and patterned morphs
or variations. Certain colors are more desired and valuable, while the typical wild-type or normal coloration is readily
available and most affordable.

Leopard Gecko Behavior and Temperament
Leopard geckos, affectionately called leos, are generally easy to care for. They do not require a lot of cage
maintenance, and they are hardy and forgiving if their environment is not perfect.

Leopard geckos are nocturnal, ground-dwelling geckos that are generally docile and easy to tame. They do not have the
sticky toe pads like other geckos, so they do not climb walls, but unlike other geckos, they do have eyelids.

Leopard geckos are not prone to biting and are usually slow-moving. They are known to be very vocal, especially when
they are hungry, and they make chirps and squeaks.

When you first bring home your leopard gecko, you can socialize it by gently handling it. They will tolerate a certain
amount of contact, but don't overdo it, or your leopard gecko may become stressed.

Geckos use their tails to communicate. If you have more than one leopard gecko in an enclosure, keep an eye out for
tail-waving. It's a slow, back-and-forth motion. The gecko often raises it, too. This sign means a leopard gecko feels
threatened and is about to attack, so separate them right away.

Leopard geckos also are tail rattlers, similar to rattlesnakes. If you see your gecko rattle the tip of its tail
rapidly, that means your leopard gecko is excited to eat or to mate.

And just like a lot of other lizards, when they feel threatened, leopard geckos can self-amputate their tails as a
defense mechanism. -->
